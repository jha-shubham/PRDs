The company has invested billions in building a global network of fulfillment centers, sortation centers, and delivery stations to ensure rapid and reliable delivery to its customers. This intricate network allows Amazon to offer services like Prime Now and same-day delivery in many cities, giving it a significant competitive advantage in the e-commerce space. The company utilizes a combination of human employees and advanced robotics to sort, pack, and ship millions of packages every day. This efficiency is a major reason why Amazon is able to dominate the retail market and consistently meet its delivery promises. The company also leverages its own fleet of aircraft, called Amazon Air, to transport goods between its facilities, further reducing transit times and giving it unparalleled control over its supply chain.        }
